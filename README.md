# AeroMeet by Gurleen

Float on air, with AeroMeet! This project was built as a part of the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021 where mentees were promoted to follow agile methodolgy to develop a video conferencing application.
<b>Motivation:</b> The need for social distancing has made each one of us feel disconnected from our family, friends, colleagues. This lack of connectedness isn’t only a detriment to employee satisfaction and wellbeing. When you consider that collaboration truly hinges on the interpersonal magic of teammates working together, it’s easy to see how the retreat to WFH could run the risk of eroding team productivity and innovation. Overhere, video conferencing platforms such as Microsoft Teams come into the picture, to feel us more connected.

<b>Solved Problem:</b> This mobile application is an online video meeting platform which powers all of your communication needs, including video meetings, one-on-one chat, audio calling, webinars, and online events.

# Tech Stack Selection 

Mobile apps have become one of the important parts of our life that connects us with people living in different places just by sitting at home hence, I decided to develop a <b>mobile application</b> so that it allows users to access the application on the go.

For frontend development, I have used <b>Flutter</b>, which helps to create cross-platform applications. For backend development, I have used <b>Firebase</b>. After deep analysis, <b>Agora SDK</b> was choosen as the most suitable real time engagement platform.

# Usage of Scrum Methodology 

Scrum is an agile development methodology used in the development of software, based on an iterative and incremental processes. The primary objective of Scrum is to satisfy the customer’s need(which in this case was a video conferencing platform) through an environment of transparency in communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress. The development starts from a general idea of what needs to be built, elaborating a list of characteristics ordered by priority (product backlog) that the owner of the product wants to obtain.

Dividing myself into five different people - one who will research and look over everything, one who will design, one who will develop the frontend, who who will develop the backend and finally one who will fix the bugs - made the task a lot easier. This breakdown helped me to be domain-oriented and focus on one task at a particular point of time.

This iterative approach assisted me to divide this large project into easily maageable sprints, increasing rate of deliverables, and adapting to changes as they occur.

I used Notion as the primary application for designing the mindmap and keeping the record of tasks, and bugs under each sprint.

I divided entire process into <b>4 sprints (each having the duration of 1 week)</b> as shown in the images below.

Assignments and sessions under the program were separately maintained.

[(Back to top)](#learnings)

1. Break the work down into the smallest chunks and smaller wins in the scrum methodology make bigger wins easier, is the most significant takeaway from this mentorship journey.
2. Got insights about the real-time video conferencing softwares such as WebRTC, Twilio, and SDKs like Agora, Jitsi_Meet SDK.
3. Model View Controller(MVC) Architecture, helped to differentiate these(Model, View, Controller) three basic components of a project to write neat and modular code. Following this approach helped me to work on each feature separately without affecting the other one.
4. Practiced Firebase Could Firestore queries in terms of multilevel collections and documents integrated with each other.

This program was all about challenging one's comfort zone and it only helped me to trasform from a person who just knew how to make static UI to a person who can build full stack mobile applications.

# Challenges Faced

During the development process I faced the following challenges: 

1. Choosing the video conferencing API. Having a lot of resources available in the market, it was really difficult to make a choice. After a lot of research, compatibility and user experience as prime factors during consideration, I finally decided to go ahead with Agora SDK.
2. Memory Management. Passing appropriate data between different pages and avoiding any memory leaks seemed like an issue at during scheduling of meetings due to continuous debugging I was able to resolve that issue.
3. Backend. For the very first time I was working with backend side hence, I was worried about the database integration and management. However, with the help of online communitites such as Stackoverflow I was able to manage this situation.
4. AeroMeet's feature list. During the design phase I wanted to build a perfect application by embedding all the features available to me but in order to buy some time I had narrow down the number of features.
5. Adapt feature. Initially, it seemed impossible to me to incorporate this feature. However, with the constant support by my parents and friends I was able to implement this feature although not covering all the aspects listed.

For me, all these challenges turned out only into one important lesson that is to prioritize customer needs above anything else.
